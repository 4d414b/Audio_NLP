The goal of this project was to study the COVID-19 call center audio data to get customer
insight. The audio data was read using pyaudio module and converted into text by using
the speechrecognition and googletrans modules in python. The relevant metrics such as call
type, call duration, call discussion etc., is extracted and sentiment analysis is performed using
VADER lexicon and TextBlob. Also performed exceptional analysis using regular expression
module and defined customer-based dictionary for topic modelling.
